<p align="center"><b>作業型態</b></p>

<p>這裡有不同型態的作業</p>

<p><b>離線作業</b> - this is useful when the assignment is performed outside
of Moodle.  Students can see a description of the assignment, but can't upload files or anything.
Teachers can grade all students though, and students will see notifications of their grades.

<p><b>上傳一個檔案<b> - this type of assignment allows all students to upload a 
single file, of any type.  This might be a Word processor document, or an image, a 
zipped web site, or anything you ask them to submit.  Teachers can grade submitted 
assignments online.
