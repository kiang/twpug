  # Download and extract the file to cake/console/libs/powerbake.php
  # Try to use this script as bake: cake.php powerbake -working /../app/
  # You have four options after executing the script
    * M = Generating all models according to tables in your database
    * C = Generating all controllers according to tables in your database
    * V = Generating all views according to tables in your database
    * A = Generating all above according to tables in your database at once

Known problems and limitations:
  # I haven't had time to figure out how to deal with table relationships automatically.
  # Test this script in non-production environments, or ... or ...

 After the models are set up, the other "bake all" functions come in more handy. I haven't checked but, I would hope there's an overwrite all in there. That's one thing I don't really like. Maybe prompt me once or use a parameter, but I hate having to punch yes to replace files.

 I don't know if it's a good idea. But you could try to disable line 421 to 432 in cake/console/libs/shell.php. You'll get the results as you wish. :)
