<DIV class="doc-parah2">
This sections describes the steps required in order to publish a translated sugar crm language pack.
</DIV>
<H3>Step 1: Importing a reference package</H3>
<DIV class="doc-parah2">
In order to published the translation of a sugar crm versions, it is first necessary to perform an import of the sugarcrm language terms.
This import can be performed on an existing sugarcrm installation, or any language pack found on the sugarforge Language pack project listing. 
Note that you can import a version of sugarcrm in any language of your choice, according to what will be the easiest to translate.
The terms of the imported package will be stored in database as the reference package of a choosen version, which can either be a new one or overwrite an existing one.
</DIV>
<H3>Step 2: Edit the manifest</H3>
<DIV class="doc-parah2">
You can edit the manifest properties of your translated language package before publishing it.
In addition, two manifest properties (underlined in orange) are required. They are the :
<UL>
<LI>Language file suffix, corresponding to the &lt;ISO639&gt;_&lt;ISO3166&gt; format for sugar crm language files. (examples : fr_FR, en_US, pl_PL etc ...)
<LI>The name of the language pack as it will appear in the Sugar CRM Drop down (actually replaces the language_pack_name property of the app_list_strings in the include/language lang file).
</UL>
</DIV>
<H3>Additional Step : Import your own dictionary</H3>
<DIV class="doc-parah2">
If you are already the owner of a translated version of sugar crm you can import your own dictionary by using the Language Pack Manager. 
This will insert in the mysql sugar_lang database the result of the terms to terms translation between a reference package and a translated package, so that you will not have to translate them again.
</DIV>
<H3>Step 3: Prepare the content to translate</H3>
<DIV class="doc-parah2">
You can prepare the content to translate by selecting the option "Create language pack definition from dictionary" in the "Translation Management" page, this after selecting the version you have previously imported.
This step will compare your translation dictionary to the the terms contained in the imported reference package.
It will result in the generation of the translated sugar terms, when a translation can be found. In the other case content will be added to the "To Translate" section.
</DIV>
<H3>Step 4: Translate</H3>
<DIV class="doc-parah2">
Once the step 3 is performed you can start to translate by accessing the "To Translate" page.
This page allows to define the translation for a given set of sugar terms. 
By commiting your changes to the dictionary you add new translations that will later be used in order to generate your translated language pack.
</DIV>
<H3>Step 5: Generate your language pack</H3>
<DIV class="doc-parah2">
Once you have translated the sugar terms, you can regenerate the content of your translated language pack by following the instruction of the step 3. 
You can after dump the content of your package, by selecting the "Dump translated package to file". 
The defined server directory will contain the content of your translated package.
</DIV>
<H3>Correcting bugs / Translating new version</H3>
<DIV class="doc-parah2">
Correcting translation errors can be performed thanks to the dictionary administration page. 
You can on this page search for your translation entries and correct them. You will just have to regenerate your language pack as described in step 5.

Two properties (underlined in orange) are required. They are the :
<UL>
<LI>Language file suffix, corresponding to the &lt;ISO639&gt;_&lt;ISO3166&gt; format for sugar crm language files. (examples : fr_FR, en_US, pl_PL etc ...)

<H3>Translation Management</H3>
<DIV class="doc-parah3">
This page allows to generate the translated content of a language pack, view the status of the translation and generate the file version of the language pack.
<H4>Select the version</H4>
You are first required to select the version that you will work with. This version corresponds to an imported language pack.
<P class="doc-note">If you have note defined the required manifest properties for the selected version, a message will appear to redirect you to the Edit Manifest page</P>
<H4>Create language pack definition from dictionary</H4>
This operation generates the content of the translated language pack.
It actually loops through the terms of the imported/reference package and seek for a term to term translation in the dictionary.
The terms that can not be translated will be appended to the content that will have to be translated (available in the To Translate page).
A report of the translated counts will be displayed after the operation.

<H4>View translation status</H4>
This options will display a progression report of the generated translated package by comparing it to the reference package. 
It provides counts of terms of each file and array for both the reference and the translated package.
Files and arrays for which the count of translated terms are less than the reference terms will be displayed in red.
<H4>Dump translated pack to file</H4>
This operation generates the files of the sugar crm language pack. A report of the generated file will be displayed after the operation.
The "Destination Directory" edit box should contain a path to a server directory with writing privileges. By default the choosen directory is the local "dumppack" directory.
When the "Include Sugar Entry Validation", the SugarCRM entry point validation will be added to each generated file (eg : "if(empty(\$GLOBALS['sugarEntry'])) die('Not A Valid Entry Point');").
